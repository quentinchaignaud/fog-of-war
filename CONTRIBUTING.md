üëçüéâ¬†First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!¬†üéâüëç

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We use GitHub Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests.

## Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.**
2.  **Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.**
3.  **Make sure your code lints and follows the coding standards.**
4.  Make sure your commits follows the [conventional commits norm](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
5.  **Issue that pull request!**

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/quentinchaignaud/fog-of-war/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/quentinchaignaud/fog-of-war/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
-   Be specific!
-   Give sample code if you can
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
